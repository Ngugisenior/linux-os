Partitions

Create a volume group,and set 8M as a extends. Divided a volume group containing 50
extends on volume group lv (lvshare), make it as ext4 file system, and mounted
automatically under /mnt/data. And the size of the floating range should set between 380M
and 400M.

# fdisk
# partprobe
# pvcreate /dev/vda6
# vgcreate -s 8M vg1 /dev/vda6 -s
# lvcreate -n lvshare -l 50 vg1 -l
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg1/lvshare
# mkdir -p /mnt/data
# vim /etc/fstab
/dev/vg1/lvshare /mnt/data ext4 defaults 0 0
# mount -a
# df -h


Create a 2G swap partition which take effect automatically at boot-start, and it should not
affect the original swap partition.


# fdisk /dev/sda

press e to create extended partition, press p to create the main
partition, and the extended partition is further divided into logical partitions) Enter

Change the logical volume capacity named vo from 190M to 300M. and the size of the
floating range should set between 280 and 320. (This logical volume has been mounted in
advance.)




# vgdisplay
(Check the capacity of vg, if the capacity is not enough, need to create pv , vgextend ,
lvextend)
# lvdisplay (Check lv)
# lvextend -L +110M /dev/vg2/lv2
# resize2fs /dev/vg2/lv2
mount -a
(Verify)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Decrease lvm)
# umount /media

Create a user named alex, and the user id should be 1234, and the password should be
alex111.

# useradd -u 1234 alex
# passwd alex
alex111
alex111



Add user: user1, set uid=601
Password: redhat
The user's login shell should be non-interactive.

# useradd -u 601 -s /sbin/nologin user1
# passwd user1
redhat


Create a 512M partition, make it as ext4 file system, mounted automatically under
/mnt/data and which take effect automatically at boot-start.


# fdisk /dev/vda

Qs-1. Configure yum client

Yum baseurl path = http://content.example.com/rhel7.0/x86_64/dvd

Solution:

# cd /etc/yum.repos.d
# rm -rf *
# vim devopsage.repo

[devopsage]
name=yum-repo
baseurl=http://content.example.com/rhel7.0/x86_64/dvd

:wq

# yum clean all
# yum list all
# yum repolist



Qs-4. Create the “LVM” with the name “fedora” by using 100PE’s from the volume group “redhat”. Consider the PE size as “8MB”. Mount it on /mnt/data with filesystem xfs.

Note: In the exam, you should create an only extended partition, don’t create a primary partition as 3 primary partitions already exist by default. So if you create a primary partition you won’t be able to create a further partition.

Solution:

# fdisk -l
# fdisk /dev/vda (create a partition with "804M" & give hexa code as "8e" for linux LVM)
# partx -a /dev/vda (run this CMD twice)
(or)
# partprobe
# pvcreate /dev/vda4
# vgcreate -s 8M redhat /dev/vda4
# lvcreate -l 100 -n fedora redhat
# mkfs.xfs /dev/redhat/fedora
# blkid
# mkdir /mnt/date

# vim /etc/fstab

/dev/redhat/fedora /mnt/data xfs defaults 0 0

:wq

# mount -a
# df -h


Qs-6. Extend the SWAP space with “512” MB don’t remove or extend the existing swap. Your new Swap should be mounted at booting time also.

Solution:

# free -m
# fdisk -l
# fdisk /dev/vda  // create a partition with 512M & give hexa code as 82
# partprobe
   (or)
# partx -a /dev/vda   // run this CMD twice
# mkswap /dev/vda5
# swapon /dev/vda5

# vim /etc/fstab

/dev/vda6 swap swap defaults 0 0

:wq

# mount -a
# free -m


Qs-7. Create a group named “admin”

A user harry and natasha should belongs to “admin” group as a secondary group with users password “wakennym”.
user sarah should not have access to interactive shell and she should not be a member of “admin” group.
Solution:

# groupadd admin
# useradd -G admin harry
# useradd -G admin natasha
# useradd -s /sbin/nologin sarah
# passwd harry
# passwd natasha
# passwd sarah

OR

# echo "wakennym" | passwd --stdin sarah
# echo "wakennym" | passwd --stdin natasha
# echo "wakennym" | passwd --stdin harry
# cat /etc/passwd    // Verify the newly created users
# cat /etc/group



Qs-8. Create the Directory “/home/admin” with the following characteristics.

Group ownership of “/home/admin” should go to “sysadmin” group.
The directory should have read, write & access permission for all members of “sysadmin” group but not to any other users. ( It is understood understand that the “root” has full access to all files present in the system).
Files created under “/home/admin” should get the same group ownership is set to the “sysadmin” group.
# mkdir /home/admin
# chgrp sysadmin /home/admin
# chmod 2770 /home/admin
# ls -ld /home/admin


Extend the existing xfs file system to a total size of 200MB and add a label called myFS.

# lvextend –size 200M -r /dev/vg/lv_xfs
or # lvextend –size +100M -r /dev/vg/lv_xfs
# umount /xfs
# xfs_admin -L “myFS” /dev/vg/lv_xfs
# mount /xfs

Create two users: john with uid/gid equal to 2000, password 12345678 and davis with uid/gid equal to 3000, password 87654321. Make davis‘ account validity stopping in one month.


Question 4 of 14
Create two users: john with uid/gid equal to 2000, password 12345678 and davis with uid/gid equal to 3000, password 87654321. Make davis‘ account validity stopping in one month.

 
Hint
# useradd -u 2000 john
# passwd john
New password: 12345678
# useradd -u 3000 davis
# passwd davis
New password: 87654321
# date -d “+1month”
# usermod -e YYYY-MM-DD davis
or # chage -E YYYY-MM-DD davis
# chage -l davis



Allow davis (and only davis) to get full access to john‘s home directory.

# setfacl -R -m u:davis:rwx /home/john

Create a directory named /common. Allow john and davis to share documents in the /common directory using a group called team. Both of them can read, write and remove documents from the other in this directory but any user not member of the group can’t.


# mkdir /common
# groupadd -g 50000 team
# chgrp team /common
# chmod 2770 /common
# usermod -aG team john
# usermod -aG team davis


Create a xfs file system on a new logical volume of 100MB called lv_xfs. Mount it permanently with uuid under /xfs.


# lvcreate –size 100M –name lv_xfs /dev/vg
# mkfs.xfs /dev/vg/lv_xfs
# mkdir /xfs
# blkid | grep lv_xfs >> /etc/fstab
# vi /etc/fstab
UUID=… /xfs xfs defaults 1 2
# mount -a



Write a Bash script called prog.sh in the /root directory that creates 40 files of 2MB each with the fallocate command in the mounted /xfs directory. Each file has got a name as follows: .file_N where N is a number from 1 toSetup a /home/rhce directory to facilitate collaboration among the rhce group.

Write a Bash script called prog.sh in the /root directory that creates 40 files of 2MB each with the fallocate command in the mounted /xfs directory. Each file has got a name as follows: .file_N where N is a number from 1 to 40.

 
Hint
cd /root
vi prog.sh
#!/bin/bash

cd /xfs
N=40
while [ “$N” -gt 0 ]
do
fallocate -l 2M .file_$N
N=`expr $N – 1`

Each member should be able to create files and modify each others’ files, but should not be able to delete any one else’s files in this directory.



Hint
# mkdir /home/rhce
# chown root:rhce /home/rhce
# chmod 770 /home/rhce

Qs-2. Configure yum client-side repository using the following URL: http://link_will_be_given_in_the_question/content/rhel7.0/x86_64/dvd

Note: This is not actually a question which contains marks, but in order to solve the rest of the questions you will have to configure Yum other wise installing packages will hardly be possible in the given time period.

Solution:

# yum repolist      // To check the repositories
# cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
# vim devopsage.repo
